Other manual means for recording what police do with their time are the Patrol Duty Returns, usually referred to as the running sheets (see Attachment 8), and their 'day book'. Both are contemporaneous notes whereby police account for their actions. My investigation identified inconsistencies in how and how well these manual records are completed between stations and even within stations. For some officers, the running sheets are used for patrols only, otherwise the day book is used. A common complaint was that officers are too busy to fill them in. There does not appear to be any systematic audits conducted on the accuracy or completeness of these documents.

{"question":"What is the People Allocation Model (PAM)?","truth":"The People Allocation Model (PAM) is a model developed by the Human Resource Division of Victoria Police. It uses statistical techniques to determine the optimal staffing levels of police officers based on socio-demographic variables that drive the demand for policing services. The model allocates a number of police officers to each Police Service Area (PSA) within regions. The PSA manager is responsible for allocating police officers to uniform sections\/stations within the PSA. The model does not determine how many officers will perform specific functions or work at specific locations. \n[en_report.pdf#page=105]","answer":"The People Allocation Model (PAM) is a model used by Victoria Police to allocate front line officers to Police Service Areas (PSAs) based on the variations in drivers of demand across the 56 PSAs. It is a \"first pass\" equitable allocation of available officers [Victoria.pdf#page=108]. PAM does not estimate the total demand for \"first response\" officers [Victoria.pdf#page=108]. The Police Association also has a model for staff allocation, which takes a \"green field\" approach and aims to identify the number of officers needed at the district level in the five regions [Victoria.pdf#page=109]. The decision about how many police officers should be allocated to the regions is determined by Victoria Police's Corporate Committee, and the PAM model calculates how many officers should be allocated to each PSA within the regions [Victoria.pdf#page=104].","context":"Victoria.pdf#page=108:  Whilst several projects have looked at modeling these, the results have been inconclusive as the determinants of such positions are policy-driven as much as demand-driven.

It is important to point out that PAM does not, nor does it claim to, estimate the total demand for 'first response' officers. I acknowledge the value of the PAM tool to provide a transparent basis for allocating police numbers to PSAs and further development would increase its usefulness to Victoria Police.

It aims to identify the number of officers needed at the district level in the five regions. The PAM model aims to identify how best to share the numbers given. As one officer described PAM ... 'it cuts a given size cake; the Police Association's model determines how big the cake should be ...

Victoria Police response: There is no understanding that CAD only relates to the metropolitan area of Melbourne and to include CAD data into a whole of Victoria model would not work for rural Victoria. Demand for services relates to rostering of resources. The PAM allocates total numbers of police to a PSA, it does not determine how many will perform what functions, work or what shifts at what locations. PSA managers and station or unit managers decide how many people to roster on each shift as a result of108 their calls for assistance. CAD and AREA data is constantly analysed and used by managers for rostering. It is also monitored for the PAM and there is a direct correlation between calls for assistance and actual crime and road trauma recorded.

When the data collected and used is of high quality, it increases trust in the accuracy and reliability of the statistics. This is crucial for the public to have confidence in the crime data and to understand the nature and extent of crime as they experience it and report it to the police.\n\nSecond, high-quality data is essential for identifying crime problems and emerging trends, measuring police performance, and responding flexibly to changing demands for police service [Victoria.pdf#page=86]. Accurate and reliable crime statistics provide valuable information for law enforcement agencies to effectively allocate resources, develop strategies, and make informed decisions.\n\nHowever, there are currently inconsistent practices in recording crime across Victoria, reflecting inadequate training and a lack of commitment to ensuring quality data at the point of recording crime [Victoria.pdf#page=12]. The current quality assurance processes are applied after the data-recording phase, which is too late. This fragmented and disconnected approach to ensuring high-quality crime statistics needs to be addressed.\n\nTo improve data quality, there should be a consistent focus on crime data quality at all levels, supported by strong leadership and appropriate organizational and management arrangements [Victoria.pdf#page=86]. This includes providing appropriate resources, trained staff, and modern information technology. Additionally, there should be a clear vision and effective management in addressing coordination issues in relation to data and information technology in the police force [Victoria.pdf#page=12].\n\nIn conclusion, ensuring high-quality data in crime statistics is important for enhancing public confidence, identifying crime problems, measuring police performance, and making informed decisions.

Deficiencies in police training Police involved in crime recording must have appropriate knowledge and skills if high quality crime recording is to occur. Appropriate training enables police to comply with crime recording policies.

The following example illustrates how some allegations of crime made by the public are handled by police. My investigators were advised that at ski resorts, theft of ski\/board equipment is frequently reported to police by the public: .... the figures go through the roof ... the Senior Sergeant says wait a week before recording them as theft and completing the LEAP forms. The reason for deferring the decision to record the crime reports is to see if the equipment is found. It may have been misplaced or taken by mistake and returned. While this practice may have been compliant with the evidentiary approach used up to 30 June 2008, police were uncertain how these matters should now be recorded under the new prima facie policy commencing 1 July 2008.

Misclassification of crime also occurs. Several examples were brought to the attention of my investigators. A senior officer stated that an armed robbery at a petrol station is a crime against the person but on LEAP was found to be misclassified as a crime against property (instead of a crime against the person). He also informed my investigators that theft of car number plates could be classified as Theft of Motor Car or as Theft from Motor Car. Victoria Police responded that it 'does not agree with the statement relating to classification of theft of number plates as either theft of or theft from motor vehicle'.

My investigation found significant differences between the calls for service or Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) data and what was recorded on LEAP. During my investigation I was also advised that a data matching exercise between CAD data and LEAP had been conducted by an internal audit in Victoria Police some years ago. The results found significant differences between the CAD data and what was recorded on LEAP. It identified under recording of crime by police - particularly in relation to assaults - and delays in recording crime on to the LEAP forms to be of concern. I consider that closer examination is required to determine why many crime events identified in the CAD system have no record on LEAP, even though an offender may have been apprehended and an offence reported.10 Victoria Police has said: While delays may occur in recording of crime by police, this does not have any correlation with the subject of the inquiry - whether the crime statistics have been manipulated.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=42:  In the NSW study the average match across all Local Area Commands was 87 per cent in 1997 and 1998, and 94 per cent in 1999 for burglary.

This is much lower than would be expected given the requirement of insurance agencies for a victim to report the theft to police. By comparison, the NSW study found the ratio of the relationship between recorded crime to calls for service in relation to motor vehicle theft ranged between 62 per cent and 75 per cent. I note the difficulties encountered in the matching exercise where it was unclear for many CAD events whether a LEAP record had been created or not. Greater harmonisation of event classification and outcome disposition categories between the CAD system and LEAP to accurately describe events reported and the circumstances found on arrival would be of benefit.

If there was no evidence of a crime, no LEAP entry would be expected and it would not be counted in crime statistics [Victoria.pdf#page=40]. However, there were significant issues with the implementation of this policy. Many officers were unaware or did not have an adequate understanding of the practical impact of the change, and there was no training provided to frontline police or station supervisors [Victoria.pdf#page=63].

It is unclear whether the expected lack of impact is due to poor understanding of the change in policy, or related more to current practices and procedures,including the inefficient manual LEAP forms, which are significant obstacles to efficient recording of crime. I am of the view that the implementation of the ABS Rule 2 by Victoria Police was inadequate. It was not accompanied by detailed explanation and scenarios to assist police to understand how this change would impact on recording practices. It appears that the implementation was rushed and there was no training of frontline police or of station supervisors. Many officers were either unaware or did not have an adequate understanding of the practical impact of the change. Police were told if they had any queries to direct these to the manager of Corporate Statistics. Other police have attempted to contact the LEAP Management Unit for clarification.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=64:  The evidence strongly suggests that police officers will continue to make their decisions based on previous practice. This practice includes a reluctance to take crime reports from victims over the telephone. According to a number of police, these could be false reports and without further enquiries makes it difficult to establish whether a crime has occurred. This can lead to delaying the decision whether to record a crime and completion of the LEAP forms. According to CDEB the time between the crime event and its recording by police on to LEAP forms and faxing them to CDEB can be as long as weeks or several months. While Victoria Police met the implementation deadline of the National Crime Recording Standard by simply promulgating the policy change, it did so without providing training to make the change effective at the 'frontline' where crime recording occurs.64 It is my view that, while Victoria Police met the implementation deadline of the NCRS by simply promulgating the policy change, it did so without providing training to make the change effective at the 'frontline' where crime recording occurs.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=40: to only record on to LEAP where there was sufficient evidence that a crime has occurred (the evidentiary approach), no LEAP entry would be expected and thus would not be counted in crime statistics.

Recorded crime numbers were at their lowest level in 2003 increasing to 2006, although remaining below survey estimates. For Sexual Assault victims, barriers to reporting these incidents to police may again impact on police figures as well as police recording practices14. 14 A further difficulty in comparing this data is that crime recorded by police is counted in the year in which it was reported to police, whereas the surveys relate to victimisation in the previous 12 months. There can be delays, often of more than 10 years, in reporting sexual assaults to police.Figure 9: Comparison between crime victim survey estimates and Victoria Police crime statistics for Sexual Assault 25000 20000 15000 + Sexual Assault, Victoria 1996 to 2007 10000 .\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=50: Figure 9: Comparison between crime victim survey estimates and Victoria Police crime statistics for Sexual Assault 25000 20000 15000 + Sexual Assault, Victoria 1996 to 2007 10000 . - 5000 0 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Crime recorded by Victoria Police - Estimated number of victims of crime from Crime Victimisation Surveys (ABS 1998, 2002 & 2005, and DoJ 1996 & 1999) The results from the comparisons between the crime victim survey data and the Victoria Police official crime figures for the five types of crime show that with the exception of Motor Vehicle Theft, there are wide differences between victim survey estimates and what is reported to and recorded by Victoria Police.

In contrast, the number of crimes recorded by police has gradually increased. This could be due in part to improved recording by police of Assaults which occur in the context of family violence, where a code of practice for police introduced in 2004 had a significant impact on both victim reporting and police recording of these incidents. The difference in levels between the survey estimates and Victoria Police figures relates partly to the reluctance of some victims to report such incidents to police, as well as to police practices regarding the recording of Assaults.48 Figure 8: Comparison between crime victim survey estimates and Victoria Police crime statistics for Assault 200000 180000 160000 140000 120000 100000 80000 60000 40000 20000 0 Assault, Victoria 1996 to 2007 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Crime recorded by Victoria Police -- Estimated number of victims of crime from Crime Victimisation Surveys (ABS 1998, 2002 & 2005, and DoJ 1996 & 1999) ","latency":8.803129,"relevance_score":5,"relevance_reason":"The answer accurately describes the trend shown in Figure 9 for Sexual Assault, mentioning the decreasing trend until 2002 followed by a rise in 2005.

Such comparisons have been conducted elsewhere, in NSW and internationally13, and are able to show the extent of under-reporting of crime by the public and under recording of crime by police themselves. My investigation was able to conduct such a comparison using estimates of crime victimisation from the available Victorian survey data with figures from Victoria Police's annual crime statistics on five types of crime. ABS Crime and Safety and DoJ survey data on three household offences (Break and Enter, Attempted Break and Enter\/Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft) and three personal offences (Assault, Sexual Assault, Robbery) from 1996 to 2007 were analysed alongside Victoria Police statistics for these offences. It should be noted that because of small numbers, the survey estimates relate to the frequency of the victimisation incidents only, not to the proportion of these incidents reported to police.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=50: between the crime victim survey data and the Victoria Police official crime figures for the five types of crime show that with the exception of Motor Vehicle Theft, there are wide differences between victim survey estimates and what is reported to and recorded by Victoria Police. relevant. As Victoria Police has been using an evidentiary approach to recording crime up to 30 June 2008, non-recording of crime could occur if police were not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for the crime. Recommendation 2 I recommend that Victoria Police use VOCAT records and crime victim surveys to enable recorded crime statistics to be compared and validated.50 Victoria Police response: The Australian Bureau of Statistics runs an annual household crime and safety survey, which collects information about individual and household experiences of selected crime and other relevant topics such as feelings of safety or problems in the neighbourhood. Interviews are conducted by telephone with respondents as part of an omnibus multi purpose household survey run from the ABS labour force sample frame. The survey is being run annually from 2008-09, with rolling collection throughout the year.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=50: Figure 9: Comparison between crime victim survey estimates and Victoria Police crime statistics for Sexual Assault 25000 20000 15000 + Sexual Assault, Victoria 1996 to 2007 10000 . - 5000 0 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Crime recorded by Victoria Police - Estimated number of victims of crime from Crime Victimisation Surveys (ABS 1998, 2002 & 2005, and DoJ 1996 & 1999) The results from the comparisons between the crime victim survey data and the Victoria Police official crime figures for the five types of crime show that with the exception of Motor Vehicle Theft, there are wide differences between victim survey estimates and what is reported to and recorded by Victoria Police.
