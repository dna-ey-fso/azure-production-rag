{"question":"What is the People Allocation Model (PAM)?","truth":"The People Allocation Model (PAM) is a model developed by the Human Resource Division of Victoria Police. It uses statistical techniques to determine the optimal staffing levels of police officers based on socio-demographic variables that drive the demand for policing services. The model allocates a number of police officers to each Police Service Area (PSA) within regions. The PSA manager is responsible for allocating police officers to uniform sections\/stations within the PSA. The model does not determine how many officers will perform specific functions or work at specific locations. \n[en_report.pdf#page=105]","answer":"The People Allocation Model (PAM) is a model used by Victoria Police to allocate front line officers to Police Service Areas (PSAs) based on the variations in drivers of demand across the 56 PSAs [Victoria.pdf#page=108].

Victoria Police response: There is no understanding that CAD only relates to the metropolitan area of Melbourne and to include CAD data into a whole of Victoria model would not work for rural Victoria. Demand for services relates to rostering of resources. The PAM allocates total numbers of police to a PSA, it does not determine how many will perform what functions, work or what shifts at what locations. PSA managers and station or unit managers decide how many people to roster on each shift as a result of108 their calls for assistance. CAD and AREA data is constantly analysed and used by managers for rostering. It is also monitored for the PAM and there is a direct correlation between calls for assistance and actual crime and road trauma recorded.

One example cited to me was of a young woman who had been denied employment due to a criminal record (located on the LEAP database); it was discovered later that the record was for another person, a male with the same name.

While some types of high volume property crime has been recorded electronically since 2005 through the LEDR initiative - Victoria Police state that 39 per cent of all recorded crime is electronically entered through LEDR on to the LEAP database - Victoria Police continues to have an out-dated approach to the recording of most crime, including all crime against the person.","latency":3.394538,"relevance_score":5,"relevance_reason":"The answer accurately addresses all the important aspects of the question by mentioning the weaknesses and deficiencies of the Victoria Police LEAP database, including incompatible systems, impeded information sharing, uncoordinated management information, variation in user interfaces, lack of common data standards, inability to link business intelligence with factual information about incidents, deficiencies in strategic planning and management, concerns relating to training, user friendliness, access to computer terminals, data integrity, and inefficient data entry practices.

The discrepancy in the police statistics, it was suggested in ABS forums, was likely to be due to a difference in how these jurisdictions recorded assaults, with NSW using a prima facie approach, whereas in Victoria, up to 30 June 2008, recording was evidentiary-based.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=89: and recording crime · increasing the use of 21st century technologies to analyse and disseminate statistics to ensure higher levels of public availability at low or no cost · releasing crime statistics more frequently - monthly, quarterly or six monthly, including regional or local government area reports · expanding the availability of time series data, including longer time series showing any breaks in series caused by legislative or procedural changes · providing comparison of police crime statistics with estimates from crime victim surveys where these are available · provide mapping products which show areas with higher than expected rates of offences, offenders or victims, based on age-sex standardisation techniques · provide more user-friendly online data selection and access tools to allow more defined, cost effective and prompt access to crime data.

The work of the Data Management Steering Committee falls within the three key priorities of that strategy: · Apply consistent data quality standards across all Victoria Police systems · Reduce complexity and duplication in data collection · Maximise accessibility to data to meet user needs. However, I consider that the effectiveness to date of this strategy has not been demonstrated.12 Inevitably, performance of a large organisation requires robust measures which allow achievement of benchmarks and targets to be assessed.

Benchmarks as suggested here have not however been set, and we will explore information that could be used for this purpose. Deficiencies in police training Police involved in crime recording must have appropriate knowledge and skills if high quality crime recording is to occur. Appropriate training enables police to comply with crime recording policies.

Only queries could be made or existing records updated; there is no direct data entry, unlike the NSW Police Service. It is not just one LEAP form that needs to be completed by police for a crime report. There are many multiple forms (Attachment 5) to be completed by hand to record different aspects of a crime incident. This may involve many sub-incidents (each is a crime count), victims (separate forms), alleged offenders (separate forms) or property stolen (separate form).

This also impacts on the availability of intelligence and on crime statistics. I am concerned by the lack of a governance framework across Victoria Police databases and applications. The LEAP system remains the primary mainframe corporate application and information system used by Victoria Police on which crime and related information is recorded and from which crime statistics are produced.

This is much lower than would be expected given the requirement of insurance agencies for a victim to report the theft to police. By comparison, the NSW study found the ratio of the relationship between recorded crime to calls for service in relation to motor vehicle theft ranged between 62 per cent and 75 per cent.

I note that a previous ministerial administrative review of Victoria Police in 2001 (known as the Johnson Report) was critical of its workforce planning, noting that the organisation did not understand or predict patterns of turnover, and had no robust basis for deploying staff to areas of high need; the separation of police and civilian staff also reduced flexibility in the allocation of staff. Work by the then Police Board between 1992-1995 had already examined issues about the operational strength of Victoria Police and how specific workload could be measured.

Due to the previous Victoria Police policy to only record on to LEAP where there was sufficient evidence that a crime has occurred (the evidentiary approach), no LEAP entry would be expected and thus would not be counted in crime statistics.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=55: crime recording practices During my investigation, I identified inconsistencies in crime recording practices and a lack of systematic auditing at the station level to address such inconsistencies. The following example illustrates how some allegations of crime made by the public are handled by police. My investigators were advised that at ski resorts, theft of ski\/board equipment is frequently reported to police by the public: .... the figures go through the roof ... the Senior Sergeant says wait a week before recording them as theft and completing the LEAP forms. The reason for deferring the decision to record the crime reports is to see if the equipment is found. It may have been misplaced or taken by mistake and returned. While this practice may have been compliant with the evidentiary approach used up to 30 June 2008, police were uncertain how these matters should now be recorded under the new prima facie policy commencing 1 July 2008.

Misclassification of crime also occurs. Several examples were brought to the attention of my investigators. A senior officer stated that an armed robbery at a petrol station is a crime against the person but on LEAP was found to be misclassified as a crime against property (instead of a crime against the person). He also informed my investigators that theft of car number plates could be classified as Theft of Motor Car or as Theft from Motor Car. Victoria Police responded that it 'does not agree with the statement relating to classification of theft of number plates as either theft of or theft from motor vehicle'.

I am of the view that the implementation of the ABS Rule 2 by Victoria Police was inadequate. It was not accompanied by detailed explanation and scenarios to assist police to understand how this change would impact on recording practices. It appears that the implementation was rushed and there was no training of frontline police or of station supervisors.

This can lead to delaying the decision whether to record a crime and completion of the LEAP forms.

Victoria Police advised Validating crime statistics can also be performed by comparing recorded crime with activity on member running sheets. This methodology was used by the Australian Institute of Criminology Review of Victoria Police Crime Statistics 2002 when it was found that the crime statistics published by Victoria Police accurately reflect the counting rules and crime classifications on LEAP.

In contrast, the number of crimes recorded by police has gradually increased. This could be due in part to improved recording by police of Assaults which occur in the context of family violence, where a code of practice for police introduced in 2004 had a significant impact on both victim reporting and police recording of these incidents. The difference in levels between the survey estimates and Victoria Police figures relates partly to the reluctance of some victims to report such incidents to police, as well as to police practices regarding the recording of Assaults.48 Figure 8: Comparison between crime victim survey estimates and Victoria Police crime statistics for Assault 200000 180000 160000 140000 120000 100000 80000 60000 40000 20000 0 Assault, Victoria 1996 to 2007 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Crime recorded by Victoria Police -- Estimated number of victims of crime from Crime Victimisation Surveys (ABS 1998, 2002 & 2005, and DoJ 1996 & 1999) ","latency":7.889445,"relevance_score":5,"relevance_reason":"The answer accurately describes the trend shown in Figure 9 for Sexual Assault, mentioning the decreasing trend until 2002 followed by a rise in 2005.

Such comparisons have been conducted elsewhere, in NSW and internationally13, and are able to show the extent of under-reporting of crime by the public and under recording of crime by police themselves. My investigation was able to conduct such a comparison using estimates of crime victimisation from the available Victorian survey data with figures from Victoria Police's annual crime statistics on five types of crime. ABS Crime and Safety and DoJ survey data on three household offences (Break and Enter, Attempted Break and Enter\/Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft) and three personal offences (Assault, Sexual Assault, Robbery) from 1996 to 2007 were analysed alongside Victoria Police statistics for these offences. It should be noted that because of small numbers, the survey estimates relate to the frequency of the victimisation incidents only, not to the proportion of these incidents reported to police.\n\nVictoria.pdf#page=50: between the crime victim survey data and the Victoria Police official crime figures for the five types of crime show that with the exception of Motor Vehicle Theft, there are wide differences between victim survey estimates and what is reported to and recorded by Victoria Police. relevant. As Victoria Police has been using an evidentiary approach to recording crime up to 30 June 2008, non-recording of crime could occur if police were not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for the crime. Recommendation 2 I recommend that Victoria Police use VOCAT records and crime victim surveys to enable recorded crime statistics to be compared and validated.50 Victoria Police response: The Australian Bureau of Statistics runs an annual household crime and safety survey, which collects information about individual and household experiences of selected crime and other relevant topics such as feelings of safety or problems in the neighbourhood. Interviews are conducted by telephone with respondents as part of an omnibus multi purpose household survey run from the ABS labour force sample frame.
